        I am a Full-stack Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience,
        specializing in MERN stack with Next Js, yet also proficient in Ruby &
        Ruby on Rails. After working as a developer for three years, I gained
        substantial experience with which I founded my own Software Development
        Company (sawabox.com) that focused on offering software solutions for
        SMEs. This venture gave me first-hand experience in managing large
        software projects with diverse specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        In over half a decade working as a developer, I have built and shipped
        100+ web apps and in the process mastered the entire Software
        Development Lifecycle (SDLC) from Needs Analysis, Project Planning,
        Prototyping, Coding, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance/Continuous
        Integration.

        I have also spent one year perfecting my remote pair programming and
        collaboration skills using tools such as Git and Github at Microverse,
        an international online coding school that takes intermediate software
        developers and refine them into world-class standard through an
        intensive 12 months program. At Microverse, I coded every day while
        working with developers around the world through remote pair
        programming. This sharpened my intercultural communication and
        collaboration skills as I also learned to work with strict deadlines
        through daily and weekly projects.
